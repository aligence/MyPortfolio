        <p>
          Alphabet Soup has identified that Americans are spending less time in nature. 
          While there are various reasons for this problem, a prevalent one is work. 
          So, we wondered if we could design an app that could encourage or make it easier for 
          people who work to get out in nature or their closest green spaces. This is because spending 
          time outdoors is linked to increases in many aspects of our health, both physically and 
          mentally, so this app is aimed to increase the wellness of its users who ordinarily would have struggled 
          to set aside time to spend in nature.
